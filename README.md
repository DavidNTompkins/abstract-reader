# This is a quick react site I use to read article abstracts.

I have a set of other scripts hosted locally that I use to extract abstracts and article information into json format. I keep that in a file on my phone (to comply with journal requests).

If you want to use this, you'll need a json formatted as below, and can try it out on reader.tompkins.computer
